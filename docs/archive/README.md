# Archived / Superseded Planning Docs

This folder preserves historical planning artifacts from Saturnis's broader emulator direction.

These documents are retained for context and prior design thinking, but they are **not** the active project plan.

## Active roadmap

Use `docs/roadmap_ymir_tool.md` for current priorities.

## Archived documents

- `saturnis_roadmap_unified.md` — former emulator-wide roadmap (superseded)
- `revised_roadmap_final.md` — prior task-driven roadmap draft (superseded)
- `roadmap_goal_task_list.md` — broad backlog/task list from earlier phase (superseded)
- `archived_roadmap.md` — prior archived checklist content (historical only)
